# Application for an ETF Analyzer

This repository contains the code for a jupyter notebook with data preparation, analysis and visualization for ETF Analyzer. 
We built a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies

The application is written in Python 3.9.7 and uses the following libraries:

* pandas - 1.3.4 - analyze and manipulate data
* hvplot - 0.7.3 - create interactive data visualizations
* matplotlib - 3.4.3 - load files from a file path
* SQLAlchemy - 1.4.22 - facilitate the communication between Python and data in a database

The application runs from the command line on Windows, Linux or Mac OS systems, or from the Anaconda Navigator Software.

## Installation Guide

*pip install SQLAlchemy
